# Developers

Yggdrasil is written in Go. All of our source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go). The codebase is fairly small and easy to navigate.

We welcome contributions, either in the form of [Pull Requests](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/pulls) or [Issues](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/issues). As this is a largely hobbyist project at this stage, it may take some time for us to get around to reviewing PRs/issues.

If you'd like to talk to us about the project or the source code, please join our [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#yggdrasil:matrix.org). 

## Platforms

Yggdrasil has been tested on a number of platforms (including Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Ubiquiti EdgeRouter). There are also packages available for a number of distributions/platforms.
